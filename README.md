# local-ai-install

Instructions and scripts to install a **local AI and AI agent environment**.

This repository provides a **reproducible, script-based (to the extent possible) setup** to deploy an isolated AI and AI agent in a virtual machine, with controlled access to system resources and GitHub repositories.

The end result is an AI and AI agent system that can collaborate with you on a public or private repository, to build software or complete other tasks.

---
# Features
 
- It should be able to write software or complete other writing tasks (e.g. a book) according to the provided instructions.  
- It should have the capability to build a software from the specifications alone. And also update the specifications and documentation to reflect the code updates.
- It should be able to write a book using the instructions on the content and the description of the audience and thhe learning outcomes.
- It should be able to accept instructions via different channels (REST API, email, chat web UI, etc).  
- When the required action is to modify the files, it should submit work as GIT pull requests for a review by the user before merging.
- It should allow the user to select which model to use when sending a request.
- It should have a list of local open models that can be installed or removed from the web UI after setup.
- It should also have a list of cloud models (together with the user's credentials or API tokens).


# 🔐 Security Model

### Isolation Layers

* VM isolates from host OS
* Docker isolates the agent inside the VM
* Dedicated Linux user (`aiuser`) isolates execution context

### Key Security Decisions

* No direct access to host filesystem
* No secrets stored in GitHub
* Secrets stored locally in `.env`
* Docker group = root-equivalent (acceptable in VM)
* Communication: Only outbound to GitHub API (restricted, authenticated)
* Pull Request workflow ensures human review gate
* All actions logged for review and debugging
* Fine-grained GitHub tokens or SSH deploy keys**: Least-privilege repository access

# Selected components and reasoning for their choice.
To achieve the stated goals, the following components are required:

## AI & LLM Layer
- **DeepSeek** (via Ollama in a separate container): Runs locally, can build software from specifications and generate written content
- **LangGraph** (Python framework): Orchestrates interactions with GitHub, filesystem, and command execution. More flexible and easier to customise than black‑box agents.

```

## How It Works With Multiple Projects

1. **Configure repositories** in `settings/repos/repos.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "repos": [
       {
         "name": "my-web-app",
         "url": "https://github.com/username/web-app",
         "branch": "main"
       },
       {
         "name": "api-service", 
         "url": "https://github.com/username/api",
         "branch": "main"
       }
     ]
   }

2. Send commands with project name:

   ```bash
   ./runtime/cli/send_task.py --project my-web-app --instruction "Add error handling to login function"

3. Agent automatically:

- Looks up repository URL from config
- Clones the specific project
- Makes changes
- Responds with answer and possibly creates PR

## Deployment

## 0. Prerequisites

* Windows host
* VMware Workstation or VMware Fusion
* Ubuntu Server installed inside VM
* Internet access inside VM
* Linux security hardening and extra packages were installed with the script [linux-initial-config.sh](0-Prerequisites/linux-golden-image/linux-initial-config.sh)
* A "Golden image" is created for this state of linux so it can be reused in the next steps (installation of Docker and AI components)


## 1. Install
> **Bootstrap** = Initial automated setup of a fresh system.

**Single-command install via URL**
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mioangr/local-ai-agent/main/setup/install-from-web.sh | bash
```

Run the deployment from your **main Linux user account**.  

If your main user is `iadmin`, you can alternative run the command via SSH:
 ssh iadmin@[IP]


It will create a temporary subfolder (e.g., `temp-web-install`) in your home directory, clone the repository into it, and run the setup.sh script from there.   

Most setup steps are safe to rerun, and the recovery scripts above can help if a previous install stopped halfway. The bootstrap performs:

* system update
* installs required packages
* installs Docker (if not already installed)
* creates `aiuser`
* adds user to Docker group
* creates working directory
* prompts for secrets and stores them in `.env`
* creates a starter `docker-compose.yml`

After setup completes and the system is running normally, that temporary install folder is safe to delete.  

If you run the web bootstrap again later and a previous installation is detected, the bootstrap will:

- automatically remove any stale `temp-web-install` folder
- ask for confirmation before resetting the existing installation
- run the install cleanup in a conservative mode that keeps Docker volumes such as downloaded Ollama models
- continue with a fresh installation after cleanup

## 3. After Setup

Switch to the AI user:

```bash
su - aiuser
```

Test Docker:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

The setup process already starts the services for you, so no reboot is required before first use. If setup completed successfully, the system is ready to use immediately.

Web pages after setup:

- Main task dashboard: `http://[vm-IP]:8000/`
- Browser chat with the local model: `http://[vm-IP]:8000/chat`
- System status page: `http://[vm-IP]:8000/status`
- Software updates page: `http://[vm-IP]:8000/updates`
- Task detail page: `http://[vm-IP]:8000/tasks/<task_id>`

### Browser-Based Live Updates

The installation can expose a browser-based updater for files that are declared safe for live replacement. In practice, these are the installed assets kept under `runtime/`, which the updater can replace from a newer manifest without rerunning the full setup. The updater checks the installed version against the online manifest and can block releases that require a full setup rerun.

The current `runtime/` reorganization is one of those structural changes, so this release is marked as requiring a full setup before later live updates can continue from the new layout.

To allow a user to apply a live update from the browser, set a dedicated updater password in the installed `.env` file:

```bash
UPDATE_UI_PASSWORD=choose-a-strong-password
```

This password is separate from the Linux password for `aiuser` and is only used to authorize browser-triggered updates.

If you add or rotate `UPDATE_UI_PASSWORD`, restart only the API container:

```bash
cd /home/aiuser/local-ai-agent/docker
docker compose up -d --force-recreate api-gateway
```

If you ever need to start the environment manually again:

```bash
cd /home/aiuser/local-ai-agent/docker
docker compose up -d
```

### Automatic Startup After Reboot

The services are configured to start automatically after a reboot.

- The Docker system service is enabled during installation with `systemctl enable docker`
- The containers use Docker Compose `restart: unless-stopped`
- Because the containers are created during setup, they are brought back automatically by the Docker daemon on boot

This automatic startup is not tied to an interactive login by `aiuser`.

- `aiuser` is used during installation and for day-to-day administration
- After reboot, the Docker daemon starts as a system service under `root`
- The containers are then restarted by Docker, not by an `aiuser` shell session

So once the installation has completed successfully, you should not need to log in as `aiuser` just to bring the services back after a normal reboot.

In short:

- After setup completes successfully, the services have already been started
- A restart is not required before you begin using the system
- After future reboots, Docker brings the services back automatically


**Other maintainance scripts**

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `rm -rf temp-web-install` | remove temp installation folder |  |
| `doctor.sh` | Inspect the installation and report what is missing or unhealthy | `cd /home/aiuser/local-ai-agent/setup && ./doctor.sh` |
| `reset-runtime.sh` | Stop containers and clear transient runtime state so you can retry the Docker/runtime steps | `cd /home/aiuser/local-ai-agent/setup && ./reset-runtime.sh` |
| `reset-install.sh` | Remove the installed project files, and optionally the dedicated user, before reinstalling | `cd /home/aiuser/local-ai-agent/setup && ./reset-install.sh --remove-user` |




## Component Placement & Responsibilities

| Component          | Location               | Purpose                                                            |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent** (LangGraph) | Docker container       | Orchestrates tasks: clones repos, runs LLM queries, executes commands, creates PRs. |
| **LLM** (DeepSeek via Ollama) | Separate Docker container | Serves model locally over HTTP. No internet needed after download.      |
| **API Gateway**      | Separate container (FastAPI) | Receives instructions from email (via webhook), chat, or REST. Queues tasks for agent. |
| **Redis / Volume**   | Docker volume          | Stores conversation memory, task queues, audit logs.     |
| **Workspace**        | Host bind mount (`/home/aiuser/local-ai-agent/workspace`) | Ephemeral clones of repos; cleared after each run or PR |
| **Secrets**          | Host file `.env` (600 perms) | Injected as environment variables into agent container (read-only). |

## Network & Security Rules

- Agent container **can only**:
  - Talk to LLM container (internal Docker network)
  - Talk to GitHub API (outbound HTTPS)
  - Talk to API Gateway (if same network)
  - Read/write within `/workspace` bind mount
- Agent container **cannot**:
  - Access host network except for above
  - Modify its own environment or Docker socket (unless explicitly needed – not recommended)
- All inbound instructions (email/chat) land on the API Gateway, which validates a simple secret before forwarding to the agent.

## How Multi-Channel Instructions Flow

1. **Email** → (optional) Postfix relay + script → HTTP POST to API Gateway.
2. **Chat** → Matrix/Telegram bot → HTTP POST to API Gateway.
3. **REST** → Direct `curl` or webhook → API Gateway.

The gateway writes a task to Redis queue; the agent polls or listens, executes, and pushes results back (e.g., textual answer, PR link, written chapters).

## Web UI and REST API

The repository now includes a small FastAPI gateway that exposes:

- a LAN-only web UI at `http://<vm-ip>:8000`
- a REST API for task submission and status lookup
- an auth-ready boundary so anonymous LAN mode can later evolve into authenticated access without replacing the architecture

Current endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /api/projects`
- `POST /api/tasks`
- `GET /api/tasks`
- `GET /api/tasks/{task_id}`

The gateway stores durable task metadata in Redis using a generated `task_id`, and the agent updates that task state as work moves from `queued` to `running` to `completed` or `failed`.

# 🔑 Secrets Management

Secrets are stored locally in:

```
/home/aiuser/local-ai-agent/.env
```

### Example:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxx
```

### Rules

* ❌ Never commit `.env` to GitHub
* ✅ File permissions are restricted (`chmod 600`)
* ✅ Script prompts user on first run

---

# 🤖 GitHub Integration Strategy

Planned approach:

* create dedicated GitHub bot account
* use:

  * fine-grained token OR
  * SSH deploy key

### Intended workflow:

* agent clones repo
* agent creates branch
* agent submits PR
* human reviews before merge

---

# 🔮 Next Steps

Planned improvements:

### 🔐 Security

* add approval layer before execution
* limit filesystem access further

### 🔑 GitHub Integration

* SSH key setup script
* fine-grained token handling
* automated PR workflow

### 🐳 Docker Improvements

* hardened container config
* resource limits (CPU/memory)
* network restrictions
